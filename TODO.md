Could the radius of the circles increase as a factor of other snakes on the screen?
(Would that improve this bot?)

We have to detect dirction of other snakes, so that:
    We can be happy to run parallel to them
    We can be happy to let others run into us
    We can detect if they are pushing us into a constriction circle
    We can run orthoganally away
    We can alter direction just enough to keep our course parallel to an attacker
